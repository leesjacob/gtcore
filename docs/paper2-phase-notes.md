# Paper 2 — phase notes

Dated sections, one per task; each number carries the command that produced
it and the commit it was run at. Timings are wall clock on the Paper 2
machine (AMD Ryzen 5 7600X, 6 cores / 12 threads, 31 GB RAM, Windows 11)
with other agents running concurrently: upper bounds.

## 2026-11-02 — Phase 1 — hidden exceptions under `GTCORE_STRICT` (task `strict-exceptions`)

Branch `p2/strict-exceptions`, code commit `bcb7a22` (requirements rev 3
§4 item 12, §6 Phase 1 fourth checkbox).

### What changed

- `gtcore/_strict.py` (new): `strict_mode()` reads `GTCORE_STRICT`
  (truthy: `1`, `true`, `yes`, case-insensitive, whitespace-stripped);
  `swallow_or_raise(logger, msg, exc)` logs the exception **with its
  traceback** through `logging` at WARNING (so it reaches stderr even with
  no logging configured) and re-raises the same exception object when
  strict. `strict_mode` is exported as `gtcore.strict_mode`.
- The three bare `except Exception:` fallbacks now call it, after assigning
  the same fallback value they always did, with a module logger
  (`logging.getLogger(__name__)`):
  1. `gtcore/tiles/auto.py` `_finish` — per-tile surface cross-check
     (`fit_on_surface`); fallback `pose.surface = None`.
  2. `gtcore/tiles/auto.py` `fit_tiles_prior` — bent-tile fit
     (`fit_deformable`) on a counted full tile the exact fit left rigid,
     i.e. a degraded-completion tile; fallback `pose.deform = None`.
  3. `gtcore/dose/hrctv.py` `build_hrctv` — HR-CTV display-shell extraction
     (`mask_to_mesh` + far-face trim); fallback `mesh=None`, rind volume
     untouched.
- `tests/conftest.py` (new, shared file): `os.environ.setdefault("GTCORE_STRICT", "1")`
  at import, so the whole suite runs strict; an explicit `GTCORE_STRICT=0`
  in the environment still wins.
- `tests/test_strict_mode.py` (new, 22 tests): flag parsing; helper with
  flag unset (no raise, one WARNING record, `exc_info` set, traceback text
  in `caplog.text`) and set (same object re-raised, still logged); each of
  the three sites driven into its `except` branch by a monkeypatched inner
  call (`gtcore.tiles.surface.fit_on_surface`, `gtcore.tiles.auto.fit_deformable`,
  `gtcore.segment.surface.mask_to_mesh`), once swallowing and logging, once
  re-raising; plus a guard test that the site-2 branch is actually reached
  (two good tiles + the crumpled phantom tile from `test_tiles_degraded`,
  `ImplantPrior(n_full=3)`, `complete_degraded=True` → one `degraded` tile
  with `deform` set).
- `scripts/strict_pipeline_check.py` (new): the acceptance-3 driver (below).

### Other `except Exception` handlers in `gtcore/` (audit, not converted)

`grep -rn -E "except Exception|except:" gtcore/ --include=*.py` at `aff83c0`:
91 sites, of which 70 are in `gtcore/planner.py` (the PyVista front-end).
Judgement per site; none is the identical "optional refinement falls back
to None" pattern of the three converted sites, so none was converted.

| Site | Judgement |
|---|---|
| `planner.py` (70 sites, e.g. 507, 541, 613, 1001, 1457, 1705, 2056, 2195, 2435) | Legitimate UI stay-alive: remove-actor / widget / key-binding / status-line calls on a live VTK interactor; failures surface in the status line (`"optimize failed: %r"`, `"dose update failed"`, `"isodose extraction failed"`). Not core-algorithm paths. |
| `interact.py:134` | Legitimate fallback: `mesh.centroid` → vertex mean when trimesh cannot compute it. |
| `interact.py:162` | Legitimate fallback: barycentric vertex normals → face normals. |
| `interact.py:257` | Borderline: ray-cast (`intersects_location`) failure silently leaves tiles un-snapped (`pass`). Candidate for the helper if the footprint fit (`rcond`, F7) work touches it; owned by another Phase 1 task. |
| `io/dicom.py:86`, `:242` | Legitimate: both `warnings.warn` with the reason and fall back (header meta empty; SimpleITK reader). |
| `io/dicom.py:136` | Legitimate: slice-geometry probe returns None → caller uses SimpleITK's geometry. |
| `phantom/generate.py:516`, `:541` | Legitimate: optional skimage streak-artifact synthesis (returns `ok`); synthetic data only. |
| `plan/api.py:114` | Legitimate: user-supplied `log` callback must not take the optimizer down. |
| `plan/candidates.py:268` | Legitimate by design (comment: "the conformer treats this as all-miss"); a chunk of rays that fails is counted as misses. |
| `plan/candidates.py:486` | Legitimate: `conform_error` is counted in `n_rejected` and reported. |
| `plan/candidates.py:772` | Legitimate: `mesh.volume` only when watertight; None otherwise. |
| `plan/milp.py:569`, `:892` | Legitimate: solver failure returns `status="error"` with the message / NaN bound (`:892` says nothing — acceptable for a bound). |
| `plan/milp.py:755` | Legitimate (commented): greedy warm start is a convenience. |
| `plan/report.py:97`, `:155` | Legitimate: optional import / `git rev-parse` probe. |
| `plan/report.py:288`, `:316`, `:337` | Legitimate: each appends `"<stage> failed: Type: msg"` to the report `notes`. |
| `plan/solvers.py:247` | Legitimate: feature probe ("is `objective.<name>` implemented") — any non-`NotImplementedError` means yes. |
| `plan/solvers.py:1043`, `:1091` | Legitimate: Nelder–Mead cost of an unplaceable tile = 1e6 / `nm_failed` counted and reported. |
| `seeds/detect.py:298` | Legitimate fallback: k-means split failure keeps the unsplit blob. |
| `tiles/deform.py:539` | Borderline: a `least_squares` failure in one restart just skips that restart silently; the other restarts still run. Diagnosable through `n_evals`; not a hidden-failure site in the sense of §4 item 12. |
| `tiles/surface.py:152` | Legitimate: cost of an unplaceable pose = 1e6 inside the optimiser loop. |

### Commands

```
# from the worktree root; conftest sets GTCORE_STRICT=1 for the suite
python -m pytest -q
GTCORE_STRICT=1 python -m pytest -q tests/test_strict_mode.py

# acceptance 3: the pipeline on PH8 and JD-1mm under strict mode
GTCORE_STRICT=1 python scripts/strict_pipeline_check.py "$GT_DATA_ROOT/<PH8>" PH8 8
GTCORE_STRICT=1 python scripts/strict_pipeline_check.py "$GT_DATA_ROOT/<JD-1mm>" JD-1mm 8
```

Note for anyone running scripts from a worktree: the venv has an editable
install of the **main checkout**, so `python some_script.py` imports that
checkout's `gtcore` unless the script inserts its repo root on `sys.path`
(12 of 22 scripts in `scripts/` do; `validation_realdata_proxies.py` does
not) or `PYTHONPATH` points at the worktree. `python -m pytest` from the
worktree root is unaffected (cwd is on the path). The runs below were made
with the worktree's `gtcore` (the driver prints which one it imported).

### Results — JD-1mm (204 slices, 0.52 × 0.52 × 1.0 mm), commit `bcb7a22`

`GTCORE_STRICT=1 python scripts/strict_pipeline_check.py "$GT_DATA_ROOT/<JD-1mm>" JD-1mm 8`
— nothing raised; script exit 0. Run twice (before and after the data
move, see the layout note below) with identical results; timings are from
the second run.

| Pass | Result | Sites exercised |
|---|---|---|
| 1 `reconstruct(auto)` | OK, 49.6 s; 31 seeds; 6 tiles (n_selected 6); surface fits 6/6, deform 6/6; meshes brain / skull / cavity (24,750 faces) | site 1 on 6 tiles — no failure |
| 2 `reconstruct(n_full_tiles=8)` | OK, 20.9 s; 31 seeds; 7 tiles (`TileFitResult`, chord score; no mesh, no deform) | none (the pipeline's count path is plain `fit_tiles`) |
| 3 `fit_tiles_prior(n_full=8, mesh=cavity)` | OK, 31.7 s; 7 tiles, 1 degraded-completed; deform 7/7; surface 7/7; 3 seeds unassigned, 0 clutter | site 2 on the 1 completed tile — no failure; site 1 on 7 tiles — no failure |
| 4 `build_hrctv(cavity, with_mesh=True)` | OK, 0.3 s; 66.8 cc; display shell present (43,695 faces) | site 3 — no failure |

Stage timings (pass 1): seed detection 0.55 s, metal inpainting 1.75 s,
head segmentation 7.92 s, cavity segmentation 3.89 s, surface meshes 5.93 s,
tile fitting 28.3 s. (31 seeds / 6 tiles is the known pre-Phase-1 state:
the vault filter drops one contoured seed and count-free saturates at 6;
those belong to the other Phase 1 / F4 tasks and are unchanged here.)

### Results — PH8 (157 slices, 0.59 × 0.59 × 1.0 mm), commit `bcb7a22`

`GTCORE_STRICT=1 python scripts/strict_pipeline_check.py "$GT_DATA_ROOT/<PH8>" PH8 8`
— nothing raised; script exit 0. The pipeline warns "vault filter skipped:
cranial interior 0 mL" (no skull) and segments no cavity, so `meshes` holds
only `skull` (32 speck faces) and `body` (72,396 faces); the planner
therefore conforms to `body` ("phantom shell"), and so do passes 3–4.

| Pass | Result | Sites exercised |
|---|---|---|
| 1 `reconstruct(auto)` | OK, 34.6 s; 32 seeds; 8 tiles (n_selected 8); surface fits 0/8 (no cavity mesh is handed to the fit), deform 8/8 | none (site 1 needs a mesh) |
| 2 `reconstruct(n_full_tiles=8)` | OK, 27.0 s; 32 seeds; 8 tiles (`TileFitResult`, chord score) | none |
| 3 `fit_tiles_prior(n_full=8, mesh=body)` | OK, 68.5 s; 8 tiles, 1 degraded-completed (the crumpled tile); deform 8/8; surface 8/8; 0 unassigned, 0 clutter | site 2 on the 1 completed tile — no failure; site 1 on 8 tiles against the 72k-face shell — no failure |
| 4 `build_hrctv(body, with_mesh=True)` | OK, 1.3 s; 262.3 cc (the whole printed shell's rind — a smoke test, not a target); display shell present (142,298 faces) | site 3 — no failure |

Stage timings (pass 1): seed detection 0.38 s, metal inpainting 0.23 s,
head segmentation 27.86 s, cavity segmentation 2.54 s, surface meshes
0.61 s, tile fitting 2.42 s.

### Full suite under `GTCORE_STRICT=1`, commit `bcb7a22`

`python -m pytest -q` (conftest sets the flag):
`837 passed, 14 skipped, 15122 warnings in 604.98s` — exit 0. That is the
829-test baseline at `aff83c0` plus the 22 new tests (851 collected). No
test drives any of the three sites into its fallback, so the strict suite
confirms the handlers were hiding nothing in the test paths either. The
warnings are the pre-existing numpy-2.5 `ar.shape =` deprecation from
scikit-image's marching cubes and the planner-optimize / tiles-suggest
runtime warnings; none is new.

### Conclusion

Under `GTCORE_STRICT=1` neither dataset raises at any of the three sites,
in the pipeline (acceptance 3) or in the planner-path calls that reach the
two sites the pipeline alone does not (`fit_tiles_prior`, `build_hrctv`).
On real data the handlers were not hiding failures at `aff83c0`; they are
now observable (WARNING + traceback) if they ever do, and fatal under the
flag. No handler intent was changed; nothing was loosened.

Data layout note: between the first and the final JD-1mm run (2026-11-03
00:05) the clinical folders were moved one level down into a `JohnDoe/`
folder under `GT_DATA_ROOT` (same folder names); the phantom folders are
unchanged. Commands above take the dataset path as an argument, so only the
path changed; the pipeline results did not.

## Phase 1 — vault filter in physical mm (2026-11-03, branch `p2/vault-filter`)

Base: `paper2/integration` at `aff83c0`. Commits on the branch:
`fbbdef2` (the fix + `tests/test_vault_filter_mm.py`), `241863c`
(`scripts/validation_clinical.py` printing only), `fad8701` (EDT on a box
around each seed). Hardware: Ryzen 5 7600X, 31 GB, Windows 11; other agents
were running concurrently, so every wall-clock figure below is an upper
bound.

### What changed (`gtcore/pipeline.py`)

- `VAULT_MARGIN_MM = 4.0`, a named module constant with the reason in its
  comment: the segmented cranial interior is bounded by the skull, and under
  the craniotomy the skull is missing, so the tiles sit against the dura
  under the bone defect, i.e. just outside the mask (contoured seeds on the
  clinical case lie up to 2.0 mm outside it, see below).
- One helper for both filter sites (the main filter and the coarse-scan
  threshold search): `in_cranial_vault(interior, vol, centers_ras)` =
  `seed_vault_distance_mm(...) <= VAULT_MARGIN_MM`. The distance is the
  Euclidean distance transform of `~cranial_interior` with
  `sampling = vol.spacing[::-1]` (array order `[k, j, i]`; `vol.spacing` is
  `(si, sj, sk)`), sampled **trilinearly** at the seed's continuous voxel
  position. A nearest-voxel lookup would misread half-voxel offsets (4.5 mm
  on a 2 mm axis rounds to the 4 mm voxel and would be kept). The transform
  runs on a box around each seed padded by the margin plus two voxel
  diagonals; a cropped transform can only over-estimate, and only beyond the
  padding, so every value up to the margin equals the full-grid value
  (asserted in the tests against the full-grid transform). Cost at the
  clinical grid size (204 x 512 x 512): 0.03 s for 32 clustered seeds,
  0.007 s / 0.12 s for 40 / 500 candidates scattered over the whole grid;
  the full-grid transform would be 6.7 s and ~1 GB, the old
  `binary_dilation(iterations=2)` measured 0.63 s under the same load.
- Replaced rule: `binary_dilation(cranial_interior, iterations=2)` = two
  voxels = 1.0 mm in-plane / 2.0 mm through-slice on the 0.52 x 0.52 x 1 mm
  clinical grid (test `test_two_voxel_rule_was_anisotropic...` shows the old
  rule dropping a seed 2 mm outside in-plane while keeping one 4 mm outside
  through-slice on a 0.5 x 0.5 x 2 mm grid).
- Fail-open behaviour unchanged (interior < 300 mL -> filter skipped with the
  same warning); `vol.meta["vault_filter"]` keeps `applied`, `interior_ml`,
  `n_dropped` and gains `margin_mm`.

### Unit tests

`GTCORE_STRICT=1 python -m pytest -q tests/test_vault_filter_mm.py` at
`fad8701`: **14 passed** (13 s). On a 0.5 x 0.5 x 2.0 mm grid a seed 3.5 mm
outside the interior is kept and one 4.5 mm outside is dropped on each of
the six axis directions (through-slice these are 1.75 and 2.25 voxels, i.e.
sub-voxel); the cropped transform equals the full-grid transform for every
distance up to the margin and gives identical keep decisions (60 random
tight clusters); `reconstruct` on the synthetic head phantom applies the
filter (interior >= 300 mL, 0 dropped, 12/12 seeds, `margin_mm` recorded)
and still fails open with empty head masks.

Full suite, `GTCORE_STRICT=1 python -m pytest -q` at `fad8701`:
**829 passed, 14 skipped** in 576.81 s (843 collected = the 829 of `aff83c0`
plus these 14; the skips pre-exist).

### Clinical case JD-1mm (the series the RTSTRUCT references)

```
python scripts/validation_clinical.py "$GT_DATA_ROOT/<JD-1mm>" "$GT_DATA_ROOT/<JD RT RTSTRUCT dir>" "$GT_DATA_ROOT/<JD RT RTDOSE dir>"
```

"Before" = the `aff83c0` pipeline. The stock script at `aff83c0` prints only
`seeds: TPS 30, detected 31; detected->nearest TPS seed median 0.16 mm, p95
4.39, max 8.74; TPS seeds with no detection within 2 mm: 1`; the matching
detail below comes from the `241863c` printing additions run against the
unmodified `aff83c0` package (read-only, same inputs). "After" = `fad8701`
(identical output to `241863c`, as the per-seed crop changes no decision).

| | before (`aff83c0`) | after (`fad8701`) |
|---|---|---|
| detections after the vault filter | 31 | **32** |
| contoured `Seeds` matched one-to-one (Hungarian, 2 mm gate) | 29/30; distance median 0.13, p95 0.75, max 0.89 mm; contoured seed 4 unmatched (nearest detection 7.49 mm) | **30/30; median 0.14, p95 0.73, max 0.89 mm** |
| plan sources = RTDOSE local maxima > 200 Gy, merged at 3 mm | 32 | 32 |
| detections matched one-to-one to a plan source (3 mm gate) | 31/32; median 0.90, max 1.45 mm; 1 source without a detection | **32/32; median 0.92, max 1.45 mm; 0 without** |
| detections without a plan source (false detections) | 0 | **0** (no new extracranial detections) |
| detections outside gtcore's cranial interior | 1 of 31 (max 0.2 mm) | 2 of 32 (max 1.9 mm = the recovered seed) |
| contoured seeds outside the cranial interior | 2 of 30 (max 2.0 mm) | same (mask unchanged) |
| `vault_filter` meta | applied, interior 1339.7 mL, 22 dropped | applied, 1339.7 mL, 21 dropped, margin_mm 4.0 |
| the two uncontoured sources | detections 10 and 17: 0.90 / 0.83 mm from an RTDOSE maximum, 7.9 / 8.7 mm from any contour, inside the interior | same |

The 21 blobs the filter still drops are shape-passing supra-threshold blobs
far from the vault (dental / jaw); only the one seed under the flap changed
side. Downstream numbers that move because the recovered seed enters the
seed hull (reported, not re-tuned): gtcore cavity 40.8 cc / Dice 0.668 vs
`Cav_Post` -> 40.7 cc / 0.671; gtcore HR-CTV 49.3 cc both (Dice vs `CTV_GT`
0.284 -> 0.285); RTDOSE on gtcore HR-CTV D90 2746 -> 2751 cGy; gtcore TG-43
at 3.5 U on `CTV_GT` from gtcore's own seeds D90 6051 / V100 91 % ->
**6168 cGy / 92 %** (RTDOSE 6365 / 94 %; TPS's 30 contoured seeds 5790 /
87 %). Unchanged: `CTV_GT` 19.0 cc, `Cav_Post` 35.1 cc, rind(`Cav_Post`)
33.9 cc, every RTDOSE row on TPS structures, the TG-43/RTDOSE ratio 0.931
(30 contoured seeds).

### Negative control PH0 and phantom PH8

Driver (no script change needed): `load_volume(path)`, then
`reconstruct(vol, verbose=False, n_full_tiles=None)` for PH0 and
`n_full_tiles="auto"` for PH8; read `len(res.seeds_raw)`, `len(res.seeds)`,
`vol.meta["vault_filter"]`, `res.implant`, `res.tiles.tiles`.
`scripts/validation_realdata_proxies.py --scans negatives,printed8` reports
the same quantities.

| | PH0 `CT 3D printed` (248 slices, 0.68 x 0.68 x 1.0 mm) | PH8 printed 8-tile phantom (157 slices, 0.59 x 0.59 x 1.0 mm) |
|---|---|---|
| before `aff83c0` | 0 raw blobs, 0 seed candidates; vault_filter applied False, interior 0.0 mL; implant present False ("only 0 candidates") | 32 raw / 32 seeds; vault filter skipped (0 mL, fails open); implant confirmed (7 gate-passing quads); auto fit 8 full tiles |
| after `fad8701` | 0 raw blobs, 0 seed candidates; `{'applied': False, 'interior_ml': 0.0, 'n_dropped': 0, 'margin_mm': 4.0}`; implant present False | 32 raw / 32 seeds; `{'applied': False, 'interior_ml': 0.0, 'n_dropped': 0, 'margin_mm': 4.0}`; implant confirmed; **8 supported full tiles, 0 tentative, 32 of 32 seeds assigned** |
| pipeline wall (upper bound, concurrent load; three runs each) | 32-35 s, of which head segmentation 24-27 s | 29-31 s, of which head segmentation 21-23 s |

### Notes for the coordinator

- Deviations from the brief's sketch, all deliberate: `sampling` is
  `vol.spacing[::-1]` (the brief wrote `vol.spacing`; array order is
  `[k, j, i]`), the field is sampled trilinearly rather than at the nearest
  voxel (acceptance test 2 cannot be met otherwise on a 2 mm axis), and the
  transform is cropped per seed for runtime.
- `scripts/validation_realdata_proxies.py` still labels the JD-1mm series a
  "pre-implant head CT" negative control in its docstring and `negatives`
  arm; it is the implant CT (32 sources). Not touched here (Phase 5 wording
  scrub).

## 2026-11-02 — Phase 1 — footprint fit rcond 1e-3 (`p2/footprint-rcond`)

Task: §6 Phase 1 third checkbox; §3 F7; §4 item 12.  Commit `6198fa1`
(code + test), on top of `paper2/integration` = `aff83c0`.

### The defect (what the basis is)

`gtcore.interact._footprint_surface` reconstructs a placed tile's conformed
collagen sheet for `find_overlapping_tiles` by least-squares fitting a
quadratic height field `z(u, v) = c · [1, u, v, u², uv, v²]` (coordinates
scaled by the 10 mm tile half-size) through the tile's own conformed points:
4 corners at (±1, ±1), 4 seeds at (±0.5, ±0.5), inset anchor at (0, 0).
Every fit point has |u| = |v|, so the u² and v² columns coincide and the
u² − v² direction is unidentifiable:

| wall | σ₆/σ₁ of the 9 × 6 basis | at `rcond=1e-6` | at `rcond=1e-3` |
|---|---|---|---|
| flat (`plan_fixtures.flat_wall_mesh`) | ~1e-16 | dropped | dropped |
| icosphere r = 25 mm, subdivisions 4 (5120 faces) | median 8.0e-5, min 6.5e-6, max 2.1e-4 | **kept** → balloons | dropped |
| icosphere r = 25 mm, subdivisions 5 (20 480 faces) | median 2.4e-5, min 1.0e-6 | **kept** → balloons worse | dropped |
| marching-cubes synthetic cavity (`make_head_phantom`, spacing 1.0 / 0.8) | median 1.4e-2, min 1.4e-3 | kept (fine) | kept (unchanged) |
| PH8 printed phantom `body` mesh (72 396 faces) | median 1.5e-2 – 6e-2, min 6.4e-3 | kept (fine) | kept (unchanged) |

On a smooth sphere the 3 mm inset along converging normals keeps |u| = |v|
exactly; only mesh faceting (~0.02 mm sagitta for a subdivision-4 sphere)
lifts the ratio to ~1e-4, above 1e-6, so the old cutoff kept the direction
and divided faceting noise by 1e-4 into coefficients of ±100s.  The sampled
7 × 7 grid (bilinear span of the corners, where u² ≠ v²) then ballooned.
`rcond=1e-3` drops the direction and lstsq returns the minimum-norm fit
(equal u², v² coefficients).  `rcond=1e-4` is NOT enough (21 % / 13 % / 6 %
of sphere tiles still > 20 mm at r = 25 / 30 / 35); 1e-2 gives the same
result as 1e-3.  Fitting u² + v² as one column was rejected earlier
(`docs/optimize-notes.md`, coordinator check 2026-10-07) because real meshes
resolve anisotropic curvature with the separate columns; 1e-3 keeps that
(ratios on real meshes are ≥ 1.4e-3, median ~1e-2).

### Icosphere measurement (60 anchors × 3 spins = 180 full tiles per sphere)

Command (scratch script, no repo change; the committed test reproduces the
R = 25 / 30 / 35 rows with 40 anchors × 3 spins):
`python <scratch>/measure_ico.py <worktree>` at `aff83c0` with the cutoff
monkey-patched.  Bounding radius = max distance of the 49 samples from
their centroid (the quantity `find_overlapping_tiles` and
`plan.conflicts._footprints` use); nominal flat corner radius 14.14 mm.

| sphere | cutoff | radius median | p90 | max | min | tiles > 20 mm | max \|r\| − (R − 3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| r 25, sub 4 | 1e-6 | 33.57 | 136.4 | 1192.5 | 12.63 | 76 % | 1190 mm |
| r 25, sub 4 | **1e-3** | **12.63** | 12.64 | 12.64 | 12.63 | 0 % | 0.08 mm |
| r 30, sub 4 | 1e-6 | 27.42 | 106.5 | 219.7 | 12.85 | 59 % | 218 mm |
| r 30, sub 4 | **1e-3** | **12.85** | 12.86 | 12.86 | 12.85 | 0 % | 0.06 mm |
| r 35, sub 4 | 1e-6 | 16.51 | 53.9 | 125.9 | 13.02 | 40 % | 124 mm |
| r 35, sub 4 | **1e-3** | **13.02** | 13.02 | 13.03 | 13.02 | 0 % | 0.06 mm |
| r 25, sub 5 | 1e-6 | 91.65 | 498.1 | 3780.9 | 12.63 | 93 % | 3779 mm |
| r 25, sub 5 | **1e-3** | **12.63** | 12.64 | 12.64 | 12.63 | 0 % | 0.06 mm |

Analytic check: the conformer insets the sheet 3 mm along normals that
converge toward the centre, so the conformed corners sit at tangential
radius (1 − 3/R) · 14.14 = 12.45 / 12.73 / 12.93 mm (R = 25 / 30 / 35); the
fitted radius is that plus the < 0.3 mm through-plane spread.  Footprint
area (sum of the 72 grid triangles; nominal 400 mm²): 1e-6 median 1816 /
1317 / 847 mm² (max 63 557); 1e-3 328.8 / 337.1 / 343.9 mm², i.e. 1.03–1.06 ×
the planar projection (1 − 3/R)² · 400 = 309.8 / 324.0 / 334.4.  Half tiles
(fit points at |u| ≠ |v|) are unchanged: radius 9.92 mm, area 160.4 mm² on
r = 25 under both cutoffs (nominal 11.18 mm / 200 mm² × (1 − 3/R)).  Flat
wall: 14.1421 mm / 400.000 mm² under both.

Planner-level consequence (`find_overlapping_tiles`, 120 tiles per sphere,
40 anchors × 3 spins; "certain" = same-wall anchors < 18 mm apart, the
optimizer's proxy rule; "impossible" = anchors > 32 mm apart):

| sphere | cutoff | pairs flagged | impossible flagged | certain pairs | certain missed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| r 25 | 1e-6 | 2313 | 907 | 1200 | 381 |
| r 25 | **1e-3** | 2180 | **0** | 1200 | **0** |
| r 30 | 1e-6 | 1344 | 432 | 867 | 249 |
| r 30 | **1e-3** | 1647 | **0** | 867 | **0** |
| r 35 | 1e-6 | 745 | 106 | 678 | 172 |
| r 35 | **1e-3** | 1229 | **0** | 678 | **0** |

### Tolerance chosen for `tests/test_footprint_rcond.py`

Tight: radius within 0.5 mm of (1 − 3/R) · 14.14, area within [1.0, 1.10] ×
(1 − 3/R)² · 400, every sample within 0.5 mm of the R − 3 sphere, for every
tile on r = 25 / 30 / 35.  Loose "nominal" band: radius within ±20 % of
14.14 mm, area within [0.70, 1.10] × 400 mm² (a correct fit is within 12 %
of nominal for any R ≥ 25 mm; the old fit's median is 2.4 × nominal at
r = 25).  Guard: `_footprint_surface(tile, rcond=1e-6)` on the same tiles
must balloon (≥ 25 % of tiles > 20 mm, max > 2 × nominal, median area >
440 mm²) and `find_overlapping_tiles` with the old cutoff must flag
impossible pairs and miss certain ones, while the new cutoff does neither.
`rcond` is exposed as a keyword (default `_FOOTPRINT_RCOND = 1e-3`) solely
for that; a test pins the default.  13 tests, 12.5 s.

### Effect on the optimizer (`gtcore/plan`, acceptance 3)

Command: `python <scratch>/measure_cavity.py <worktree>` (both cutoffs,
`build_candidates(h_mm=5, n_spins=3, kinds=("full","half"))`,
`build_conflicts(robust=False/True)`):

| mesh | candidates | footprints moved > 0.1 mm | planner-rule pairs (1e-6 → 1e-3) | robust pairs (1e-6 → 1e-3) | proxy-added | tiles > 20 mm (both) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `make_head_phantom(spacing=1.0, n_tiles=3, rng_seed=1)` (test fixture), 12 300 faces | 596 | 0 | 62 305 → 62 305 | 63 876 → 63 876 | 1571 | 8 |
| `make_head_phantom(spacing=0.8)` (test_overlap fixture), 20 080 faces | 608 | 0 | 62 787 → 62 787 | 63 969 → 63 969 | 1182 | 6 |

No conflict pair, footprint sample or footprint-area value changes on the
marching-cubes meshes; the `tests/test_plan*` expectations are unchanged.
The 8 / 6 candidates with bounding radius 20–34 mm on those meshes are a
different phenomenon: full-rank fits (σ₆/σ₁ = 2e-3 – 1e-2, residual
0.2–0.7 mm) through corners that sag 5–13 mm asymmetrically on lumpy wall
patches — the quadratic extrapolates steeply over the grid.  `rcond` cannot
touch them (and should not; they are not noise amplification).  The
optimizer's proxy rule (`conflicts.robust=True`) stays in force for those.

### PH8 printed phantom (acceptance 4)

Command: `GT_DATA_ROOT=... python <scratch>/ph8_footprints.py <worktree>
"$GT_DATA_ROOT/<PH8>"` at `6198fa1`; `load_volume` → `reconstruct(vol,
n_full_tiles="auto" | 8, n_half_tiles=0)` → `tiles.auto.to_placed_tiles`,
then the planner's adoption rule (`snap_to_wall(center) + conform_tile`) and
the V6 `as_implanted_conformed` rule; candidates `build_candidates(h_mm=5,
n_spins=3, eligible_faces=visible_faces(mesh, seed centroid))`.  Pipeline:
157 × 512 × 512, 0.592 × 0.592 × 1.0 mm, 32 seeds, 8 tiles in both modes,
28.6 s / 25.2 s (other agents running concurrently; upper bounds).  No
`cavity` mesh on the phantom — the wall is the `body` mesh (72 396 faces),
as in the V6 campaign.

| tile set (PH8) | n | radius median 1e-6 → 1e-3 | min | max | area median | tiles > 20 mm |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `to_placed_tiles`, auto (flat sheets from the fit) | 8 | 13.26 → 13.26 | 10.46 | 14.68 | 351 | 0 |
| `to_placed_tiles`, N = 8 | 8 | 14.14 → 14.14 | 14.14 | 14.14 | 410 | 0 |
| planner snap + conform, auto | 8 | 16.79 → 16.79 | 13.23 | 28.16 | 573 | 3 |
| planner snap + conform, N = 8 | 8 | 16.03 → 16.03 | 13.62 | 21.22 | 507 | 1 |
| V6 `as_implanted_conformed`, auto / N = 8 | 8 | 16.79 / 16.03 (unchanged) | | 28.16 / 21.22 | 552 / 507 | 3 / 1 |
| `build_candidates` h 5 mm, 3 spins, visible wall | 82 | 16.41 → 16.41 | 13.27 | 58.99 | 503 | 13 |

σ₆/σ₁ on every PH8 tile ≥ 6.4e-3 (medians 1.5e-2 – 6.2e-2): nothing in the
(1e-6, 1e-3] window, so the before/after medians are identical.  The
rcond change is a no-op on the printed phantom and on the synthetic
cavities; it matters on smooth, symmetric walls (the icosphere, and any
smooth/decimated clinical mesh), where it removes the ballooning entirely.
The 1–3 conformed PH8 tiles and 13 / 82 candidates above 20 mm are the
rough-wall extrapolation case noted above (the `body` mesh includes the
printed cavity's lumpy surface), unchanged and out of this task's scope.

### Tests

- `python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests/test_footprint_rcond.py` at
  `6198fa1`: 13 passed in 12.5 s.
- Planner / optimizer files (`python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider
  tests/test_overlap.py tests/test_interact.py tests/test_planner*.py
  tests/test_plan_*.py tests/test_validation_optimize_smoke.py`) at
  `6198fa1`: 306 passed, 14 skipped in 391.9 s (skips are the pre-existing
  optional-solver / data-dependent ones; no expectation changed).
- Full suite `GTCORE_STRICT=1 python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider` at
  `6198fa1` (the flag is not yet read by the tree at `aff83c0`; set for the
  record): 828 passed, 14 skipped in 613.3 s (842 collected = the 829
  baseline at `aff83c0` + the 13 new tests; 0 failed, 0 errors).
- After merging `paper2/integration` (`d722022`, strict-exceptions; the
  conftest now sets `GTCORE_STRICT=1`) into this branch as `09e7fc7`:
  `python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider` 850 passed, 14 skipped in
  517.7 s (864 collected = 842 + the 22 strict-mode tests; 0 failed).
  The only merge conflict was this notes file (both tasks created it);
  resolved by keeping both sections under the strict-exceptions header.

Hardware for the timings: AMD Ryzen 5 7600X, 31 GB RAM, Windows 11, with
other agents running concurrently (timings are upper bounds).

## 2026-11-03 — Phase 1 — cavity reach in physical mm

Task `cavity-reach`, branch `p2/cavity-reach` (from `paper2/integration` at
`aff83c0`).  Code commit **`0efe5eb`** ("cavity: hull pad and reach in
physical mm on anisotropic grids").  All "before" numbers are at `aff83c0`,
all "after" numbers at `0efe5eb`; `HULL_REACH_MM = 14.0` and
`SHEET_TOL_MM = 3.0` were **not** changed.

### The defect

`gtcore/segment/cavity.py::_cavity_from_seed_sheet` grew the cavity with
`ndimage.binary_dilation(start, iterations=round(reach_mm / min(spacing)),
mask=grow_mask)` and padded the seed hull with
`binary_dilation(hull, iterations=round(tol_mm / min(spacing)))`.  Both are
voxel steps of a 6-connected element, i.e. an L1 ball in voxel units.  On
the JD-1mm grid (0.52 × 0.52 × 1.0 mm) the nominal 14 mm reach was 27 voxel
steps = **27 mm through-slice, 14 mm along an in-plane axis, 9.6 mm on an
in-plane diagonal** (and 8.1 mm on the body diagonal); the 3 mm pad was 6
steps = 6 mm through-slice.  Even on the isotropic 0.7 mm synthetic phantom
the "14 mm" region was an octahedron of 14 mm half-axis, 1/π of the volume
of the 14 mm sphere.

### The fix (`0efe5eb`)

Two helpers in `gtcore/segment/_morph.py`, both taking physical mm on every
axis; `cavity.py` calls them in place of the two dilations:

- `dilate_mm(mask, spacing, radius_mm)` — exact Euclidean ball,
  `distance_transform_edt(~mask, sampling=spacing) <= radius_mm`, full
  resolution (the pad).
- `geodesic_grow_mm(start, mask, spacing, reach_mm)` — geodesic distance
  through the growth mask: the Eikonal equation |∇T| = 1 solved on the
  voxel grid with the per-axis spacing (fast marching, Sethian 1996), Godunov
  upwind update, **second order** along each axis where two upwind
  neighbours are known (first order otherwise and as the fallback when the
  second-order root is not causal), iterated to a fixed point over the
  active voxels only (fast iterative method, Jeong & Whitaker 2008,
  vectorised in numpy).  The 26-neighbour shell of the start that a
  three-step face path can reach is seeded with its exact Euclidean
  distance (removes the first-order point-source error).  Only face
  neighbours exchange values, so the growth keeps the 6-connected topology
  of the dilation it replaces (never crosses a one-voxel wall or a diagonal
  crack).  Propagation stops at `reach_mm`, so the work scales with the
  grown region.  Rejected alternatives: 26-neighbour Dijkstra
  (`skimage.graph.MCP_Geometric`) is a chamfer metric, 12 % long on oblique
  directions and 26-connected; first-order fast marching alone is 11–14 %
  long on oblique directions; resampling to 1 mm isotropic and dilating
  still gives an L1 octahedron.

Accuracy of the discrete distance in free space (point source, 14 mm
reach), `tests/test_cavity_reach_mm.py`:

| grid (mm) | extent +k / +j / +i | in-plane diagonal | r from volume | worst \|T − Euclid\| | mean |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.5 × 0.5 × 2.0 | 14.00 / 14.00 / 14.00 | 13.44 (next diagonal voxel 14.15) | 13.81 | 0.44 mm | 0.18 mm |
| 0.52 × 0.52 × 1.0 (JD) | 14.00 / 13.52 / 13.52 (27th voxel at 14.04) | 13.97 | 13.99 | 0.16 mm | 0.01 mm |
| 0.7 iso (synthetic) | 14.00 / 14.00 / 14.00 | 13.86 | 14.03 | 0.19 mm | −0.04 mm |

Same point, old rule, JD grid: 27.0 / 14.0 / 14.0 mm, in-plane diagonal
9.6 mm (`test_old_voxel_step_rule_was_anisotropic`).

Tests: `tests/test_cavity_reach_mm.py` (12 tests: 14 ± 1 mm sphere on both
anisotropic grids — axes, in-plane diagonal, volume-equivalent radius;
free-space distance within half the largest voxel; pad is a Euclidean ball
and equals `euclid <= 3 mm` voxel for voxel; geodesic detour around a wall
within 5 %; one-voxel wall and diagonal crack never crossed; degenerate
inputs; synthetic 0.7 mm phantom Dice ≥ 0.83 and reach monotone 10 < 14 <
18 mm).  Existing `tests/test_phantom.py`, `tests/test_integration.py`,
`tests/test_segment_units.py` unchanged and green.  Full suite at the
docs commit (`python -m pytest -q`, no `GTCORE_STRICT` flag exists in the
tree yet): **827 passed, 14 skipped in 8 min 54 s** (841 collected = the
829 of `aff83c0` + these 12).

### Re-measurement at `HULL_REACH_MM = 14` (not re-tuned)

**(a) Phantom.**  The "phantom Dice" column of the reach sweep in
`docs/clinical-validation-notes.md` §4 was the *synthetic* phantom
(`gtcore.phantom.make_head_phantom()` at its defaults: 0.7 mm isotropic,
3 tiles, rng 0, truth cavity 26.3 cc), through the demo / integration path
(`detect_seed_candidates → inpaint_metal → segment_head → segment_cavity`);
`pipeline.reconstruct` with the reach patched in gives identical Dice and
volume.  The printed phantom PH8 has **no cavity mask** before or after
(0.0 cc, 0 voxels at both commits): the printed shell has no brain-window
tissue, the cranial interior is 0 mL and the sheet rule returns an empty
mask — as already recorded in `docs/optimize-notes.md` V6 ("no cavity
segmented").  There is therefore no PH8 Dice to report, and none existed
before.

```
python scripts/cavity_reach_sweep.py --reaches 12,14,16,20          # synthetic
python scripts/cavity_reach_sweep.py --ct "$GT_DATA_ROOT/<PH8>"     # printed phantom
```
(`scripts/cavity_reach_sweep.py` is added in the commit that adds this
section; it packages the scratch measurement used at `aff83c0` / `0efe5eb`
and reproduces the rows below bit for bit — the Dice/volume path is the
same code.)

| reach | Dice before (`aff83c0`) | volume before | Dice after (`0efe5eb`) | volume after |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 12 mm | 0.812 | 21.0 cc | 0.873 | 25.0 cc |
| **14 mm** (default) | **0.839** | **22.8 cc** | **0.896** | **26.9 cc** |
| 16 mm | 0.888 | 24.9 cc | 0.920 | 28.8 cc |
| 20 mm | 0.911 | 29.3 cc | 0.903 | 31.5 cc |

(The §4 table in `docs/clinical-validation-notes.md` — 0.808 / 0.851 /
0.886 / 0.924 — was measured at `2046a07`; the seed-localization changes
merged since moved the `aff83c0` baseline to the "before" column here.
That table is now historical: voxel-step growth.)

**(b) Clinical JD-1mm vs `Cav_Post`.**

```
python scripts/validation_clinical.py "$GT_DATA_ROOT/JohnDoe/<JD-1mm>" \
    "$GT_DATA_ROOT/JohnDoe/<JD RT RTSTRUCT>" "$GT_DATA_ROOT/JohnDoe/<JD RT RTDOSE>"
```
(the "before" run used the pre-move paths `$GT_DATA_ROOT/<...>`; same
files.)  Cavity-stage runtime from
`python scripts/cavity_reach_sweep.py --ct "$GT_DATA_ROOT/JohnDoe/<JD-1mm>" --rtstruct "$GT_DATA_ROOT/JohnDoe/<JD RT RTSTRUCT>"`
(`reconstruct(verbose=True)` stage timings; Dice identical to the
validation script's).

| | before (`aff83c0`) | after (`0efe5eb`) |
|---|---|---|
| gtcore cavity volume | 40.8 cc (151 071 vox) | 41.4 cc (153 444 vox) |
| Dice vs `Cav_Post` (35.1 cc) | 0.668 | 0.663 |
| covers `Cav_Post` / of ours inside it | 72 % / 62 % | 72 % / 61 % |
| gtcore HR-CTV (5 mm rind of gtcore cavity) | 49.3 cc | 50.9 cc |
| HR-CTV Dice vs `CTV_GT` / `CTV_Post` | 0.284 / 0.324 | 0.284 / 0.324 |
| RTDOSE D90 / V100 on gtcore HR-CTV | 2746 cGy / 38 % | 2725 cGy / 38 % |
| gtcore TG-43 (our 31 seeds, 3.5 U) D90 on gtcore HR-CTV | 2659 cGy | 2601 cGy |
| seeds (unchanged by this task) | 31 detected, 29/30 matched | same |

Everything else in the validation output (TPS structures, `CTV_GT` rows,
rind of `Cav_Post`, implied S_K 3.76 U) is byte-identical before and after.

**(c) Cavity-stage runtime** (`reconstruct` timing of "cavity segmentation",
which includes the hull / sheet-normal work, the growth, closing and fill;
upper bounds, see hardware note):

| dataset | before (`aff83c0`) | after (`0efe5eb`) |
|---|---|---|
| synthetic 0.7 mm phantom (286³) | 1.4–1.5 s | 1.7–2.0 s |
| PH8 (157 × 512 × 512) | 2.16 s | 2.25 s |
| JD-1mm (204 × 512 × 512) | 3.67 s | 3.91 s |

A repeat of the JD-1mm "after" run with
`scripts/cavity_reach_sweep.py --ct ...` (while the test suite was running)
gave 3.56 s, so the before/after difference on the clinical case is within
run-to-run noise.  Isolated growth step on a JD-sized 90 × 180 × 180 box
with a 60 %-random mask (prototype benchmark): old `binary_dilation × 27`
0.05 s → geodesic 0.7 s.  Full pipeline on JD-1mm stays ≈ 20 s of stage
time.

### Reading (reported, not acted on)

- **Synthetic phantom: Dice up at every reach ≤ 16 mm, 0.839 → 0.896 at
  the default.**  Expected direction: at equal nominal reach the Euclidean
  ball has π times the volume of the L1 octahedron, so the oblique reach
  grew from 8–10 mm to 14 mm and the far wall of the one-sided implant is
  now reached; the 14 mm volume now matches the truth (26.9 vs 26.3 cc).
  The sweep is no longer monotone: it peaks at 16 mm (0.920) and falls at
  20 mm (overshoot, 31.5 cc).  **Not re-tuned** — the rule is synthetic +
  phantom first and never on the clinical case; if the coordinator wants a
  re-tune of `HULL_REACH_MM` it is a separate, declared decision for Table 2.
- **Clinical: essentially unchanged** (+0.6 cc, Dice −0.005, coverage of
  `Cav_Post` 72 % both ways).  Cutting the through-slice reach from 27 to
  14 mm removed almost nothing and the extra in-plane oblique reach added
  almost nothing, so at 14 mm the clinical cavity is bounded by the
  low-density mask and the seed-sheet clip, not by the reach.  The 28 % of
  `Cav_Post` never covered is still the clot / debris above 26 HU
  (`docs/clinical-validation-notes.md` §4), not a reach effect.  Mildly
  surprising only in that the 27 mm through-slice growth was not what let
  the cavity into the oedema.
- **F6 numbers to regenerate** from this commit onward: gtcore HR-CTV 50.9
  cc, RTDOSE D90 2725 cGy on it (the 2863 cGy / 49.9 cc in
  `clinical-validation-notes.md` was at `2046a07`, 2746 / 49.3 at
  `aff83c0`).  The `IMPLANT_REACH` row of F6 does not exist yet (Phase 2
  `targets.py`).
- `docs/clinical-validation-notes.md` §4 (reach sweep, HR-CTV 2863 cGy) and
  the `cavity.py` module docstring's "41 cc / Dice 0.65 / 0.85" are now
  historical; left in place (Phase 5 scrub / README drift), with a pointer
  from the `HULL_REACH_MM` comment to this section.

## 2026-11-02 — Phase 1 — packaging, lock file, test tolerance

Branch `p2/packaging` (worktree `p2-packaging`), based on `paper2/integration`
= `aff83c0`. Requirements rev 3 §6 Phase 1 fifth checkbox, §4 item 12 (the
`rtree` / tolerance parts), brief "Rules" (3.11/3.12 venv, lock file, declare
`rtree` and `pymedphys`). Commits:

| Commit | What |
|---|---|
| `3d10eb9` | `pyproject.toml`: `rtree>=1.0` runtime dependency; `requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.13"`; extras `dev = ["pytest>=8"]`, `clinical = ["pymedphys>=0.41", "numba>=0.60"]`, `viz = ["pyvista"]` (unchanged) |
| `a5d3d13` | `tests/test_tiles_fuse.py`: `test_no_covariance_is_bit_identical_to_the_historical_fit` → `test_no_covariance_is_identical_to_the_historical_fit_to_1e6`, `np.testing.assert_allclose(rtol=1e-6, atol=1e-8)` on R, t, (kappa1, kappa2, psi), rms; assignment / wrms / None checks kept; `seed_cov=None` vs default kept exactly equal (same code path); module docstring says "identical ... to 1e-6" |
| `9ebb13d` | `requirements-lock.txt` (new) and `README.md` (Install section + Python-version bullet) |
| `3921ee0`, `7706697` | this notes section (then appended to the shared notes file) |
| `9179bce`, `dba5ff0` | merge of `paper2/integration` (strict-exceptions + vault-filter) into this branch so it merges clean; notes file = integration's two sections + this one |

### 1. pymedphys / numba (what was installed, exact versions)

Shared project venv (Python 3.12.10, numpy 2.5.2, scipy 1.18.1 — both unchanged):

```
python -m pip install pymedphys      # pymedphys 0.41.0 (+ setuptools 84.2.1, tomlkit 0.15.2; typing_extensions already present)
python -m pip install numba          # numba 0.68.1 + llvmlite 0.50.0
python -c "import pymedphys; from pymedphys import gamma; print(pymedphys.__version__)"   # 0.41.0
```

- `pymedphys 0.41.0` declares `requires_python >=3.10,<3.13` (hence the 3.11/3.12
  bound in `pyproject.toml`). Its *base* install pins nothing on numpy/scipy
  (`numpy>=1.26` and `scipy` appear only under its `user`/`docs` extras), so it
  does **not** downgrade the venv. `pip install --dry-run --report` confirmed
  only `pymedphys`, `setuptools`, `tomlkit` would be added.
- `import pymedphys; from pymedphys import gamma` works on the bare install, but
  **calling** `gamma(...)` with the default `interp_algo="pymedphys"` needs
  `numba` (`pymedphys/_interp/interp.py` is `nb.njit`) and raises
  `ModuleNotFoundError: PyMedPhys was unable to import "numba.njit"`.
  Two working paths, both verified on a 20^3 synthetic grid (3 %/2 mm, pass rate
  1.0 over 8000 voxels):
  - `gamma(..., interp_algo="scipy")` — no numba needed (scipy
    `RegularGridInterpolator`);
  - the default path with `numba 0.68.1` installed (numba pins
    `numpy<2.6,>=1.22` and `llvmlite<0.51,>=0.50.0dev0`; compatible with numpy
    2.5.x, nothing downgraded).
  The `clinical` extra therefore lists both `pymedphys>=0.41` and `numba>=0.60`
  so Phase 3's `gtcore/dose/gamma.py` works with pymedphys' default settings.
  **Coordinator decision:** keep numba in the extra (default pymedphys path, but
  numba's `numpy<2.6` cap will bite on the next numpy minor), or drop it and have
  the Phase 3 wrapper pass `interp_algo="scipy"`. Either way the lock file pins
  a working set.
- `pymedphys[user]` was *not* used: it pulls streamlit, pymssql,
  anthropic==0.29, scikit-learn, shapely and more.

### 2. Lock file (`requirements-lock.txt`)

Produced from a *fresh* venv in `<scratchpad>/lockenv` (not the shared venv),
Python 3.12.10 (CPython, Windows AMD64), pip 26.3:

```
python -m venv <scratchpad>/lockenv
<lockenv>/python -m pip install -e ".[dev,clinical]"        # 32 packages; 754 of 829 tests collect (test_planner*.py importorskip pyvista)
<lockenv>/python -m pip install -e ".[dev,clinical,viz]"    # + pyvista 0.49.2, vtk 9.7.1, pooch, scooby, ... -> all 829 collect
<lockenv>/python -m pip freeze --exclude-editable > requirements-lock.txt   # header with Python / pip version prepended
```

The lock therefore covers runtime + `dev` + `clinical` + `viz` (a superset of
the task's `[dev,clinical]`, chosen so the lock reproduces the *complete* test
suite — without pyvista 75 planner tests are silently skipped). Key pins:
numpy 2.5.4, scipy 1.18.1, scikit-image 0.26.0, SimpleITK 2.5.7, pydicom 3.0.2,
trimesh 5.2.0, rtree 1.4.1, matplotlib 3.11.2, pymedphys 0.41.0, numba 0.68.1,
llvmlite 0.50.0, pyvista 0.49.2, vtk 9.7.1, pytest 9.2.0. The editable `gtcore`
line is excluded. (The shared venv differs slightly: numpy 2.5.2, trimesh 5.1.0,
SimpleITK 2.5.6, pyvista 0.48.4, vtk 9.6.2, pytest 9.1.1 — both sets pass.)

### 3. Test runs

Hardware: AMD Ryzen 5 7600X, 6 cores / 12 threads, 31 GB RAM, Windows 11 Home
10.0.26200. Other agents ran test suites and installs concurrently, so both
wall-clock figures are **upper bounds**. `GTCORE_STRICT=1` was set for both
runs but is a no-op at `aff83c0`/`9ebb13d` (the flag comes from the
strict-exceptions branch); the last row, after merging `paper2/integration`,
runs with the flag functional (`tests/conftest.py` sets `GTCORE_STRICT=1`).

| Run | Commit | Interpreter | Command | Result | Runtime |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline, shared venv, worktree | `aff83c0` (test modules collected before this branch's edits) | shared venv, Python 3.12.10, numpy 2.5.2 | `GTCORE_STRICT=1 python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider` | `815 passed, 14 skipped, 15122 warnings in 558.68s (0:09:18)` | wall 9 min 21 s |
| Edited file only, shared venv | working tree of `a5d3d13` | shared venv | `GTCORE_STRICT=1 python -m pytest -q tests/test_tiles_fuse.py` | `13 passed in 16.84s` | — |
| **Clean clone, fresh venv from the lock file** | `9ebb13d` | `<scratchpad>/clonenv`, Python 3.12.10, numpy 2.5.4 | see below | **`815 passed, 14 skipped, 161 warnings in 646.89s (0:10:46)`** | wall 10 min 49 s (pytest only; venv + lock install took 64 s with a warm pip cache) |
| Clean clone, same lock-file venv, after merging `paper2/integration` (strict-exceptions + vault-filter, 36 new tests) | `dba5ff0` | `<scratchpad>/clonenv` (lock and pyproject unchanged, no reinstall) | same recipe with `git checkout dba5ff0` | `851 passed, 14 skipped, 164 warnings in 508.82s (0:08:28)` | wall 8 min 30 s |

Clean-clone recipe (the brief's "tests green on a clean clone" check; it also
exercises the README Install paragraph):

```
git clone --no-hardlinks --no-checkout <repo> <scratchpad>/clone
cd <scratchpad>/clone && git checkout p2/packaging
python -m venv <scratchpad>/clonenv
<clonenv>/python -m pip install -r requirements-lock.txt
<clonenv>/python -m pip install --no-deps -e .
GTCORE_STRICT=1 <clonenv>/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider
```

The 14 skips are identical in both runs and none needs a data folder: 13 are
`tests/test_plan_interface.py` placeholders ("<name> is implemented (see its
own test module)") and 1 is the `tests/test_planner_optimize.py` end-to-end
optimizer run gated on `GT_E2E=1` (~1–2 min). No test reads `GT_DATA_ROOT` or a
real dataset; the suite is synthetic-phantom only.

### 4. `rtree` — mechanism check

`rtree` is imported nowhere in gtcore; it is `trimesh`'s spatial index, listed
only under trimesh's own `easy` extra, and `trimesh.util` imports it lazily for
`trimesh.proximity.closest_point` (used by `gtcore/interact.py:148` and the
HR-CTV / DVH paths). Verified in the lock venv with `pip uninstall rtree`:
`tests/test_interact.py::test_conform_reproduces_phantom_truth` fails with
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'rtree'` (trimesh/util.py:1896); rtree
1.4.1 was reinstalled afterwards. The "169 tests error" count from the
requirements doc was not re-measured (no full-suite run without rtree).

### 5. Shared files touched (for the merge)

- `pyproject.toml` — dependency list, `requires-python`, extras; comments
  explain each line.
- `README.md` — minimal: one new `## Install` section (10 lines) before
  `## Quick start`, and the "Python ≥3.9-compatible core" bullet under
  Conventions now reads "Python 3.11 / 3.12 (`requires-python` in
  `pyproject.toml`)". The "805 tests" strings and other README drift are left
  for Phase 5.
- `tests/test_tiles_fuse.py` — one test + the module docstring only.

## 2026-11-03 — Phase 1 close-out — planner drag test made deterministic (coordinator)

`tests/test_planner_interaction.py::test_ctrl_left_drag_relocates_and_stays_conformed`
failed intermittently on `origin/main` aff83c0 (1 of 4 full runs today;
"seed 1.02 mm from wall after drag") and once on the Phase 1 tree, passing
alone every time. Cause: `_PlannerApp._drag_move` paces re-conforms by
wall-clock time (`drag_min_interval_s`), so under load only some of the nine
synthetic mouse moves applied, and the test's end point (80 px / 25 px from
the anchor) is off the wall, so the tile landed at whichever intermediate
step last passed the pacing gate; with that pose one seed sat 1.9–2.0 mm
from the lumpy marching-cubes wall, at the test's 2.0 mm bound. Repro script
(four repeats per setting): default pacing moved 6.2 mm once and 23.7 mm
three times; pacing off always 23.7 mm; release-only 0.0 mm (end point off
the wall). Fix (test only, no planner change): `drag_min_interval_s = 0`,
end point 60 px / 15 px asserted on the wall. Three consecutive module runs:
32 passed each. Full-suite reference at the Phase 1 merge d063c23:
875 passed, 14 skipped, 1 failed (this test); the four-merge tree 2630550:
876 passed, 14 skipped.
